I am a software engineer and a hardware enthusiast. I built large scale trading surveillance services while I was at Morgan Stanley. Over time I grew a deep interest with new hardware and joined DFRobot.

This is where I leave my thoughts and perhaps some random observations.

I try my best maintaining a writing habit.

Some of the articles may not have complete source codes or projects attached due to Firm policy. However details of how-to will be given instead.
