<p>Last time I left a bit in the <code>TODO</code>, saying that I will test with multiple clients on a host. I did.</p>

<h2 id="env-setup">Env setup</h2>

<p>To compare the testing, I will give you the hardware settings:</p>

<p>Host			|CPU Core#	| Mem

VMware Guest	|1			|4g
Physical		|2			|8g</p>

<p>The clients are all VMware Guest Ubuntu Desktop machines cloned from the server. They have the same file limits, etc, nothing special.</p>

<p>I use bridge, not NAT for the network connectivity for the VMWare Guests, so they are just like other machines setup on the local network, not wrapped up inside the VM.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Quite interesting. The VM Guest, no matter how I tune the numbers, cannot establish more than 655XX TCP connections, regardless of the IP/port combinations.</p>

<p>I tried to use HAProxy with another guest machine, and I get ~32000 frontend connections, and ~16000 backend connections to each of my two backend Mosquitto servers. So that is about 655XX TCP connection in total.</p>

<p>I kind of scratch my head when I cannot pass that threshold. I checked the values everywhere and I am sure my configuration is able to host more TCP connections than 655XX. Besides, this number is way too suspicious. I tried half a dozen times and the cap is always 655XX. Then I suspected VMWare.</p>

<p>Okay I need proof.</p>

<p>I used the same step to install a vanilla Ubuntu with the same iso image, followed the same steps I wrote myself to setup the server on the physical machine and guess what, I got more connections as expected.</p>

VMware Guest	|90%+	|0.4%	|2000+/s -&gt; ~100/s| <strong>65,535</strong>
Physical		|90%+	|0.4%	|3000+/s -&gt; ~100/s| <strong>100,000+</strong></p>

<p>The speed of establishing new connections wears down gradually. Mosquitto can build up 10K connections in a few seconds, but the speed slows down after that.</p>

<p>I got over 100K live TCP connections with a physical machine, using only 0.4% memory. That is very impressive indeed.</p>
